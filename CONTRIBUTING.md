# Contributing to sf-extension-utils

We would love for you to contribute to sf-extension-utils and help make it even 
better than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like 
you to follow:

 - [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit)

## Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. 
This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through 
the project history. But also, we use the git commit messages to generate the change log.

We strongly suggest that you use the Angular commit [message](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) conventions.
