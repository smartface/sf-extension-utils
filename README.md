## Installation
Utility extension can be installed via npm easily from our public npm repository. The installation is pretty easy via Smartface Cloud IDE.
Run the following code in terminal
```shell
(cd ~/workspace/scripts && npm i -S sf-extension-utils)
```
## How to use
### 1. Fix global methods
In `app.js` make sure that `require("sf-extension-utils")` is set. This is fixing `alert`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout` and `clearInterval` methods. Some of the other util modules might depend on it!
### 2. Require util modules
Later in any file, require it with the path: `require("sf-extension-utils/lib/<moduleName>")` Such as:
- `require("sf-extension-utils/lib/rau")`
- `require("sf-extension-utils/lib/permission")`
- `require("sf-extension-utils/lib/fingerprint")`
- `require("sf-extension-utils/lib/speechtotext")`
- `require("sf-extension-utils/lib/location")`

### API
For each module api documentation is in separate file. Please visit [doc](./doc) folder

# Update sf-extension-utils
## Update to 4.0.0
If you are updating from earlier versions than 4.0.0, you need to change your code:
1. Make sure that the code in `app.js` is like `require("sf-extension-utils")` before calling any other util modules
2. Change your codes based on the new access format
    - Old: `const <moduleName> = require("sf-extension-utils")`.<moduleName>
    - New: `const <moduleName> = require("sf-extension-utils/lib/<moduleName>")`
    - Some modules have renamed, based on the file name. They have the same names as in documentation. Please check [doc](./doc) folder for new module names.
